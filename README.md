# VulnFeed

VulnFeed is a project born out of having so many vulnerabilities and so little time.

The goal of this project is to have a service that sorts through vulnerability reports to give you a single report that is organized by the applications and services you are interested in. This brings the stuff you care about out of the massive pile of vulnerabilities that are reported each day.

No more filled email inboxes and no more slow perusings of massive vulnerability lists.

## Development

This service is written in Python 3. It uses Flask for the frontend with Bootstrap.

This is currently very alpha-level stuff! Feel free to contribute.
